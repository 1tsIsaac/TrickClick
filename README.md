### Steps:
1. Create a directory called `frames`,
2. - Add `frame1.png` (the image that people will see when its uploaded to Discord) to frames,
   - Add `frame2.png` (the image which will be displayed when opened in the browser) to frames,
3. Run interface.py,
4. You are done! The final image will be located in the `completed` directory that gets created once the program exits.

### Tips:
- You want to make sure that `frame1.png` and `frame2.png` are of similar resolution, otherwise a lot of quality could be lost and the final image may look stretched.
